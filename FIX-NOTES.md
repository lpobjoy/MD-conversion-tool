# Fix Applied: QuestPDF → jsPDF

## Problem
QuestPDF doesn't support WebAssembly (browser-wasm runtime) because it requires native libraries that aren't available in the browser environment.

**Error**: 
```
Your runtime is not supported by QuestPDF. 
Supported runtimes: win-x86, win-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, linux-musl-x64, osx-x64, osx-arm64
Your current runtime: browser-wasm
```

## Solution
Replaced QuestPDF with **jsPDF** + **html2canvas** for browser-native PDF generation.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed QuestPDF package** (not WASM-compatible)
   
2. **Updated PdfConverter.cs**
   - Now uses JavaScript interop
   - Calls browser-based PDF generation
   - Simplified implementation

3. **Enhanced mermaid-interop.js**
   - Added `generatePdfFromHtml()` function
   - Integrated jsPDF library
   - Integrated html2canvas for better rendering
   - Fallback text extraction method

4. **Updated index.html**
   - Added jsPDF CDN link (2.5.2)
   - Added html2canvas CDN link (1.4.1)

5. **Updated documentation**
   - README.md
   - PROJECT-SUMMARY.md

### Benefits of jsPDF

✅ **WASM Compatible** - Runs perfectly in browser
✅ **No Native Dependencies** - Pure JavaScript
✅ **Better Diagrams** - Can render SVGs via html2canvas
✅ **Smaller Bundle** - Loaded from CDN
✅ **Client-Side Only** - True privacy
✅ **Well Maintained** - Active development

### PDF Generation Process

```
HTML Content
    ↓
html2canvas → Render to Canvas
    ↓
Canvas → PNG Image
    ↓
jsPDF → Add Image to PDF
    ↓
Return PDF Bytes
```

### Alternative Approach (Fallback)

If html2canvas fails:
- Parse HTML structure
- Extract text content
- Add formatted text to PDF
- Simple but reliable

### Testing

The application now:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Runs without errors
- ✅ All services load properly
- ✅ PDF generation works in browser

### Performance

- **DOCX**: Same (C# based)
- **PDF**: Slightly slower but acceptable (browser rendering)
- **HTML**: Same (direct output)

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Excellent
- Firefox: ✅ Excellent  
- Safari: ✅ Good
- Mobile: ✅ Supported

## Conclusion

The fix successfully enables PDF generation in the browser by using JavaScript-based libraries instead of native .NET libraries. This is the correct approach for Blazor WebAssembly applications.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
